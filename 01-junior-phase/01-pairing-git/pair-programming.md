# Pair Programming Lecture

## Which pair will see the least/most improvement vs. a solo developer with the same experience? Why do you think that?

- Novices will have the most improvement & experts the least.
  - novices have much more romo for growth ++
  - ++
  - ++
  - Novice/novice because they have the least chance of overlap in their core knowledge base!
  - Novice/novive: more mistakes and the greatest imrovoement is made by making mistakes + learning from them.
- Intermediates: both have a good amount that they know + also to learn. ++++
  - ++ ++
  - both have room to grow but also the technical knowledge + communication to explain to one another.
- Improvement in all except when you mix different expertise levels!!



## How might it effect the pairing session if the participants have different experience levels? How is it different if the Driver or the Navigator is the stronger participant?

## What can be done to mitigate these issues?

- For both driver/navigator experiences, it depends on the patience of the expert.
  - Patience is most important for the expert!
  - Expert/Novice: can be frustrating if expert is the driver.
- If expectations aren't communicated at the beeginning, it can cause frustration between the two programmers.
  - Depends on the communication of both people.
- When the navigator has less experience, they have more opportunity to learn.
- Slow down and communicate, be patient.
- Seems like stronger navigator is preferred to stronger driver.
  - If the more experienced + knowledgeable participant is always driving, less chance for navigator to learn.
  - I feel like if the navigator has more experience, the process could run more smoothly. They would be able to spot more errors and help to teach and lead the driver.
  - Having the more experienced person be a navigator would help this situation. It allows for more learning from the driver
- Novice/Expert pair: strongest for novice to grow if the aim was for the novice to learn.
- May feel one sided if positions aren't rotated.
  - Driver/navigator should rotate often (every 20 minutes, or after every portion of a feature/workshop section)
- Remembering to slow down to get to know your teammate + how they work/learn.
- An expert driver can more easily assume the navigator role, while an expert navigator can not easily steer the novice in the right direction.
- even with patience the time required to finish the project will increase, as the more experienced one has to explain the process
- a stronger driver may be inclined to just go alone
- The expert could take over and dictate everything, and in this the novice  wouldn’t learn much. To avoid such situations, just always communicate with your partner, slow down if need be, and don’t be afraid to ask questions to get clarification.
- in an actual driving situation though, the expert driving first & instilling confidence in the ability of the vehicle to the novice is a valuable experience. This might also apply to a programming situation
- the person with more experience should also see it as a opportunity to learn by explaining concepts to a person with less experience
